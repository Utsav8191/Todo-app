# :page_with_curl: About The Project

This is a Todo application built using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. The application allows user to add multiple tasks, mark them as complete and also remove them as they please.

- The App uses local storage to persist the data, so the user doesn't loose added tasks even when the browser is refreshed.
